  <h1> Fun Facts about Dogs! </h1>
    <ol>
      <li><b> Diverse Breeds:</b> There are over 340 recognized dog breeds worldwide, each with its own unique characteristics and traits. </li>
      <li><b> Amazing Sense of Smell:</b> Dogs have an extraordinary sense of smell, estimated to be tens of thousands to a hundred thousand times more sensitive than humans. </li>
       <li><b> Communication Skills:</b> Dogs communicate primarily through body language and vocalizations. They use their ears, tails, posture, and facial expressions to convey emotions and intentions. </li>
       <li><b> Diverse Abilities: </b> Dogs are incredibly versatile animals and can be trained for various roles such as hunting, herding, search and rescue, therapy, and even detecting diseases like cancer and diabetes. </li>
       <li><b> Social Animals:</b> Dogs are pack animals by nature, which is why they often form strong bonds with their human families and other animals. They thrive on social interaction and companionship. </li>
       <li><b> Puppy Love:</b> Puppies are born blind, deaf, and toothless, completely dependent on their mother for nourishment and warmth in the first few weeks of life. </li>
       <li><b> Tail Wagging:</b> Contrary to popular belief, dogs donâ€™t only wag their tails when they're happy. Tail wagging can also indicate excitement, nervousness, or even aggression, depending on the context and speed of the wag. </li>
       <li><b> Dreaming:</b>  Dogs experience rapid eye movement (REM) sleep just like humans, which suggests they dream. You might notice your dog twitching, vocalizing, or moving their paws while asleep. </li>
